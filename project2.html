							<p>   AQI which is abbreviated as Air Quality Index is the measure of pollutants present in the air. It represents the severity of Air Quality as Moderate, Satisfactory, Good, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe. A higher value of AQI indicates more air pollution. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe. AQI helps in analyzing the change in air quality (improvement or degradation) and also informs the public about environmental conditions. It is especially useful for people suffering from illnesses aggravated or caused by air pollution. 
                                </p>
							<p>  We have Emphasized on Pre-covid Dataset because During the Covid-19 period, the lockdown was mandated by the government regarding the usage of personal vehicles so, many people have not used personal vehicles. Having analyzed the impact of COVID-19 induced lockdown on Air Quality in Hyderabad city by carrying out a time-series analysis of the data. We fitted a SARIMA model with computed orders to forecast India's AQI in the next three years i.e., 2021, 2022, 2023. The dataset is fed for training into the machine learning algorithms of Regression and using SARIMAX For Forecasting each pollutant, after that, we Calculated the root mean square and saw the value as 2.49, which is a positive sign to forecast the data. The model was evaluated using sklearn metrics and performance scores, such as accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure, receiving operating characteristics (ROC) area, etc.
                                As our time series are influenced by a lot of external factors. SARIMAX can incorporate both seasonal and non-seasonal factors in a multiplicative model. Therefore, when the time series exhibits a seasonal variation, the SARIMAX model is applied Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of how the quality of the air is present in the environment
