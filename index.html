									<h3>SPARKS FOUNDATION</h3>
									<p>As a Data science and business Analytics intern at The Sparks Foundation. I worked on a project where I predicted student percentages based on their study hours, I have used supervised learning as the goal was to forecast rather than identify insightful trends. For regression analysis, I harnessed the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm, then divided the data to train and test with each model. Finally, I evaluated and plotted the prediction and Uploaded the repositories to <a href = "https://github.com/Saiakhilesh25/Sparks-Foundation/blob/main/task1.py">Github.</a>The <a href ="C:\Users\durga\OneDrive\Desktop\Project4thyr\Internship.jpg">Internship</a> helped me to sharpen my programming skills and gain real-world experience.</p>
