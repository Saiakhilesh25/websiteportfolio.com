                            <p>  I have worked with a team and we created a data set for the project, from scratch through a Google Form where we asked the students an array of questions like the issues faced during the online classes, the mode of attending online classes, and gave options in radio button as Mobile, Pc, Tablet. Then we preprocessed the collected data and removed the outliers and analyzed the data through tableau and identified the correlation between key attributes. Based on the analysis we concluded the students preferred Online Mode over Offline Mode.
                                .
