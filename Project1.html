							<h1 class="major">PLAGIARISM DETECTION IN ONLINE EXAMS</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/project1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In the current scenario, computer-based exams have increased due to the pandemic, it is feasible to cheat the
                                exam and obtain high scores through unorthodox methods, and it is also possible to
                                detect unethical examinees. So, various data enthusiasts have used different approaches to
                                detect them: some used camera video data for face patterns, others use computer
                                display video data for anomaly detection, and so on. All of these approaches are
                                good and work well for the problem. The difference between them and my
                                approach is that I looked for patterns with mouse movements and
                                keyboard strokes. I picked this method because the video data per examinee is
                                too enormous, and I want something that uses less data, yet solves the
                                problem.
                                Mouse and keyboard strokes are textual data, the important necessary
                                attributes for the project are mouse position, keystroke button, and time. That's it
                                and the size of video data is 50-100 times more than our data. Due to efficiency in
                                size and easy implementation of machine learning algorithms on textual data I
                                have chosen this way.
                                </p>
							<p>For training and testing, I created an exam
                                and collecting mouse movements and keystrokes where few are positive dataset
                                and a few negative datasets and then I used machine learning techniques of
                                different classification and different clustering algorithms on the collected data,
                                also, I used anomaly detection techniques to find the data points
                                which will help in improving the model. At last, I evaluated the result and if
                                necessary redo the data collection over and over until I made final decisions and
                                conclusions accordingly.
                                I used data augmentation to address the problem of underfitting the
                                model, as I will aim to obtain the proper quantity of data required for the project.
                                The duration of the exam, the size of the screen (for establishing mouse locations),
                                and other parameters all affect the mobility of data collection.
